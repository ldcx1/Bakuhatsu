# Bakuhatsu
A simple LibGDX game.

There are some small bugs regarding the interface. 

Game wise, Box2D seems to not like what I did when there are many bodies in world, as it starts checking for collison between objects that are setted to not collide.

A small preview for the game:

Also I do not own any of the images that are used in the game.
